# 🩺 Chest X-ray Disease Classification using Deep Learning & Flask

## 🧠 Project Overview

This AI-powered web application classifies **14 chest diseases** from X-ray images using the power of **Deep Learning**. Built with **Flask** and **TensorFlow**, it integrates **DenseNet-121** for image classification and **Grad-CAM** for explainability. The tool provides doctors and radiologists with real-time insights, aiming to enhance medical diagnostics with speed and transparency.

## 🧬 Dataset

- **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**  
  - Source: [NIH ChestX-ray14 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data)
  - Over **100,000 X-ray images** annotated with **14 different pathologies**.

## 🚦 How It Works

1. 📤 User uploads a chest X-ray image.
2. 🧠 Model processes the image through DenseNet-121.
3. 📊 Grad-CAM generates a heatmap to highlight affected regions.
4. 🖥️ The prediction and explainability visualization are displayed on the web interface.
